# Portfolio Performance Converter

A project to learn Rust and to convert CSV files from banks into [Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/) CSV format, for when the built-in conversions are not enough.

## Avanza

Download CSV of transactions from *Min ekonomi -> Transaktioner -> [Set date range] -> Exportera transaktioner*.

Run the converter on the CSV.

Manually create the security and cash/deposit accounts in Portfolio Performance.

Import the resulting *portfolio transactions* and *account transactions* CSV files into Portfolio Performance.
